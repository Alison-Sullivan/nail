"Network address information logger" is a simple tool with the goal of logging any changes related to a devices network addresses in order to ease that "what just happened" question during troubleshooting.

The reason this tool was origonally written in batch was for a requirment of compatibility going back to Win XP. Since the compatability requirement for XP no longer exists I do have plans to finish, correct, and rework the tool in powershell however I don't have a current or immediate need for it so this is a "when I can" type of situation.
